// Sounds for the Subway Game. For a production app, it's better to host these
// as .mp3 files on a CDN and use their URLs to avoid bloating the JS bundle.
// However, for small, critical sounds, base64 can be acceptable.

// These have been replaced with valid but silent WAV files to prevent loading errors.
// Replace these with your actual full base64 audio strings.
